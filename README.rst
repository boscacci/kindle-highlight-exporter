    Have you ever wanted to save the text you've highlighted on your kindle to a neat text file? This repo is for you!


* I wanted to be able to export highlights I made while reading to a neat google doc or comparable.
* Amazon has something that [lets you save highlights from certain books](https://www.howtogeek.com/449256/how-to-backup-your-kindle-highlights-and-notes/), but not DRM-free books. (Almost none of the books on my kindle are DRM protected)
* There's already a [tiny web app which accomplishes the same thing](https://erkanerol.github.io/kindle-clippings-extractor/), but the UI and resulting text output are not as neat as I would like.
